<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a catalogue of recipes. It's a single page application that shows list of food items that can be filtered based on food type. It also shows the details of individual food items.
It's built with React and Redux.
It's also built with an API (Application Programming Interface). The data on the API are obtained, stored on Redux store, and then displayed on the browser through async fetch request.
It's a SPA application (with both main, show, and About Us pages). These pages are implemented using React's Router feature.
All the data from the API are displayed on the index page. The API employed here is [themealdb API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).
The details of individual food items are displayed on the show page, and the About Us page tells more about the Catalogue Of Recipes.
The application throws an error when a user inputs the wrong url on the browser.
